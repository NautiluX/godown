GoDown: Markdown Previewer
==========================

GoDown is a markdown previewer (using websockets) that uses the [BlackFriday][bf] markdown processor to output HTML to all of it's connected clients.

GoDown is heavily inspired by [Livedown][ld], a markdown previewer that is written in NodeJS.


## TODO ##
- Finish the websocket server (allow for browser choice like livedown)
- Write a vim plugin to do instant preview
